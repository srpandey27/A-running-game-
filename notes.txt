Meeting 1 (in class, Thurs, Feb 3)


Meeting times:
11-12 Friday Peirce
Tues 9:30


Asmod used javascript & .io stuff to code a web-based game in software development in less than a month with a team of 3 people. So the coding should be very doable, and we'll have time to learn. We could learn bootstrap to make the interface nicer (it's a template).


Questions for teacher: 
* All we know so far is that we want to ask them questions about what they want. Do you want us to run the entire class? If so, what should we be teaching them? Do you want us to teach the class actual coding or just the process of software design? Testing software and giving feedback won't take an entire class period. 
* Is there anything in particular you want the game itself to help students learn?


Questions for students: 
* What do you guys want to see in a game? What kind of games do you like? Sports? 
* What do you want this game to help you learn? 
* Things it could teach: vocab words, spelling, science simulation


We seem to be collaborating well without a set leader for now. We'll see if we need one later. Alex will be the recorder. Asmod will be the Git Manager because he has previous experience with Git. Alex will take the lead on prioritizing teaching the class if that's something the teacher wants us to focus on.



Day 2:
School:

ask them to draw on the board and talk through what they think a user would do in the program

leaderboard with top person total, of week, and of day

Saurav made a couple quick website games. The code is very short. So this will be doable in a week or two.

Talk to teachers and ask if there's something the students are struggling to learn, something they need to practice more.

Topics:
- math, pattern recognition
- music
- science
- grammar

Questions & hangman-style response
Animation will probably be too difficult
Shoots and ladders game with questions

Asynchronous or versus

What kind of thing we're trying to make:
- take something that is boring to learn and make it fun. ask what they don't like learning
- similar to a cool math game in terms of complexity


Plan for class:
- Ask them what they find the most boring or miserable to learn/practice 
- Ask what kinds of games they like. Have them look around coolmath.com
- Hopefully we’ll narrow in on one or two ideas and be able to start planning the layout and other details


Saurav & Alex will meet outside Wiggin Street Coffee at 2:07 so we get to the school around 2:15. That will give us 20 minutes with the class.
